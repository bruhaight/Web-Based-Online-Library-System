# Web Based Online Library System ðŸ“š

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my semester project! This readme provides an overview of the web-based online library system I have developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Let's dive in!

## Project Overview

The web-based online library system is designed to provide users with a convenient platform to browse, search, and borrow books online. It offers various features such as user registration, book listing, borrowing, returning, and book recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-library-system.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the MongoDB database:

   - Start MongoDB server
   - Create a new database and configure the connection in the `.env` file.

4. Build and run the project:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Feature Highlights

1. **User Registration** - Users can create an account and login using their credentials. User information is securely stored in the MongoDB database.

2. **Book Listing** - The library system displays a wide range of books available for users to explore. Users can view book details, including the title, author, description, and availability status.

3. **Borrowing** - Users can borrow books by clicking on the "Borrow" button. The system keeps track of borrowed books and the return dates.

4. **Returning** - Once users have finished reading a book, they can mark it as returned. This updates the availability status and allows other users to borrow the returned book.

5. **Book Recommendations** - The system provides personalized book recommendations based on the user's previous borrow history and interests. This feature enhances the user experience and encourages further engagement with the platform.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some possible future enhancements for the web-based online library system:

- Implement an advanced search feature, allowing users to search books by genre, author name, publication date, etc.
- Introduce an online reservation system to allow users to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
- Enable users to write book reviews and provide ratings.
- Incorporate an administrative dashboard for librarians to manage the library system efficiently.
